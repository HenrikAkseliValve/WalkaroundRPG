# Walkaround RPG
Obsolete RPG project. Uploaded for CV purposes.

Code is located at the src/FunRPG. At src/org directory is old versions of slick and LWJGL files I found relevant.
These libraries are manually build to make the code run. Some edits have been made to avoid other libraries.

NOTE: Does not run at this point since LWJGL needs wrapper shared library.
